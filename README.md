## What is the FIRST Robotics Competition?
The FIRST® Robotics Competition (or FRC) is an event where high school-aged teams compete head to head on a special playing field with robots they have designed, built, and programmed.  For more information about FIRST and FRC, please visit www.firstinspires.org.
